# Experiments with Autoencoders

###### *Alice, December 2019*
---

This is the repository for the development of artificial neural networks with autoencoder-like architectures.

The deep learning framework of choice is Keras 2.2.4 using TensorFlow 1.12.0 backend. The scripts are executed with Python 3.6.8. The networks are trained on multiple GPUs with CUDA 10.1.
<!--The neural models obtained from Keras are exported to __Wolfram Mathematica 11.3__ for visualization.
-->

## Neural architectures

#### Standard autoencoders (AE and VAE)
The first set of neural models we developed are simple autoencoders having a single color image as input, and are trained to reconstruct the same image as output, in a totally unsupervised way. We initially developed a standard autoencoder, and then we improved it into a variational autoencoder.


#### Topological autoencoders (MAE and MVAE)
A second set of neural models shares the encoder structure of the previous models, but tries to explicitly learn in the latent space a compressed representation of the location of cars and lane markings in the scene. We developed these architectures initially with a standard latent space, and then using variational Bayes.

There are 3 different decoders reconstructing, respectively, the initial color image, a binary mask indicating the locations of other cars, and a binary mask for the location of lane markings. The 2 "topological" branches of the network require a supervised training, with the use of segmented ground truth. 


#### Temporal autoencoders (RAE, RVAE and RMVAE)
The third set of neural models expands the previous architecture with the inclusion of temporal information. A sequence of frames is fed to a topological autoencoder, which produce a corresponding sequence of latent spaces. This sequence is passed to a reccurent network predicting a new sequence future latent spaces, which are then expanded to images through the same decoder of the topological model.

This architecture is not directed at performing prediction in the long future, but it is trained to obtain a more refined latent representation that takes in consideration also the temporal coherence between frames.


#### Predictive models (TIME, RTIME, RMTIME)
The last set of neural models focuses on long-term prediction of future sequences, using as input/output only the latent representations computed by the temporal autoencoders.

## From Keras to Mathematica
For the sake of convenience, the definition and training of neural networks is done entirely in Keras, which allows a very light coding and wide support from the online community. Also the training on multiple GPUs is easily handled.
Unfortunately, there is no direct way to import in Mathematica a neural model created in Keras. Mathematica supports the import of model weights from _HDF5_ files, but the model architecture must be recreated from scratch using Mathematica.
The downside of this approach is that there is no full compatibility between the neural network modules of Keras and Mathematica. One of the main issues is the different handling of convolution padding, which is done automatically in Keras while in Mathematica is still quite intricate. As a consequence, there seems to be no way to recreate in Mathematica a series of deconvolutional layers as in Keras. So further work is needed.

## Test results

##### Hallucination
These are the results of testing the **RMTIME** model using the *hallucination* technique: the predicted output of the recurrent network is fed as input of the next recursive iteration. In this way the network is really "imagining" the future road scenarios.
The two animations show on the right the ground truth sequence, on the left the imaginary sequence produced by the network, executed for 40 iterations:

## Usage
To run the program, execute the main script `src/exec_main.py `. The script supports the following command line arguments:

```
exec_main.py [-h] -c <file> -g <num> [-f <frac>] [-l <model>] [-T] [-t] [-r] [-s] [-a] [-e]
```

- `-a`, `--accur` execute accuracy evaluation on selected samples (`-a`) or on all test set (`-aa`) *(it may take a while!)*.
- `-c <file>`, `--config <file>` pass a configuration file describing the model architecture and training parameters.
- `-e`, `--eval` execute evaluation routines.
- `-f <frac>`, `--fgpu <frac>` set the fraction of GPU memory to allocate *[default: 0.90]*.
- `-g <num>`, `--gpu <num>` set the number of GPUs to use (0 if CPU) or list of GPU indices.
- `-h`, `--help` show the help message with description of the arguments.
- `-i`, `--intrp` execute interpolation tests.
- `-l <model>`, `--load <model>` pass a folder or a HDF5 file to load as weights or entire model.
- `-p`, `--pred` compute model predictions over a selected set of images.
- `-r`, `--redir` redirect _stderr_ and _stdout_ to log files.
- `-s`, `--save` archive configuration file (`-s`) and python scripts (`-ss`) used.
- `-t`, `--test` execute testing routines.
- `-T`, `--train` execute training of the model.

As example, run the following command from the upmost `autoencoder/` folder. This command will train a new model on the first GPU on the machine. Then it will test the results, save all the files required to reproduce the experiment, and redired all console messages to log files:

```
$ python src/exec_main.py -c config/cnfg_file -g 0, -Ttssr
```

Another example, this command will load an already trained model and will execute all the test routines on CPU:

```
$ python src/exec_main.py -l log/nicemodel/nn_best.h5 -c log/nicemodel/config/cnfg_file -g 0 -taaeip
```
